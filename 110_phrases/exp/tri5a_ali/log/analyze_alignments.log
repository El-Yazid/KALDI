The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 16.0% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 87.1% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 11.3% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.1 hours of data, or 0.1 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 7.1% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (12,17.2,37)
