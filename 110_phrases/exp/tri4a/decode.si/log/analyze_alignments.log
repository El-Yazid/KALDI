The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 29.7% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 88.0% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 24.8% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 16.7% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (16,18.9,36)
