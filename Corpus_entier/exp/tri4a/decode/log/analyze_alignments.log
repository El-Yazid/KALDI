The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 86.7% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 39.6% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 67.7% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.5 hours of data, or 0.1 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 11.4% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (101,129.9,331)
