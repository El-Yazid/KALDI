The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 50.4% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 28.6% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 5.5% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.2 hours of data, or 0.1 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 3.3% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (9,14.1,32)
